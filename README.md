This repository contains a collection of games I've developed (or collaborated on). Each game is stored in its own repository for easier management and collaboration.

## **John Lemon But Juicy!** 
> My first exposure to Unity GameDev. I have added some upgrades like a stealth capsule, a minimap and lives+kill counter. Do check it out! [`sauce`](https://github.com/npqr/John-Lemon-But-Juicy)

## **Hexify** 
> It is a fun game on the lines of "Connect 4" but hex-themed. You can play as single player as well as a 2-player mode is supported. The art for this game was contributed by me. It was our submission for Takneek '23 (inter-hall tech competition) GameDev PS. [`sauce`](https://github.com/npxx/tknk-hexify)
  
## **`CLI`rdle** 
> During lockdown, I used to play wordle almost daily and thought to make a command-line interface (CLI) version of the same. The name pretty much is justfied :) [`sauce`](https://github.com/npxx/clirdle)

## **vizu-galaxy** 
> I made this one as an educational game wherein you're travelling in space and learn about the different celestial objects while driving a spaceship. I also simulated the formation of galaxy using Unity Particles. [`sauce`](https://github.com/npxx/vizu-galaxy)

## **bt mat lo!**
  > This game was developed as a part of an internal game jam at GameDev Club, IITK. It is a nice take on the theme of game jam -- cheating! [`sauce`](https://github.com/npxx/btmatlo)

## **airo-clash** 
  > This game was developed as a submission for Takneek '24 GameDev PS. It is a minimal Air Hockey game with little support for single player mode. [`sauce`](https://github.com/npxx/airoclash)
